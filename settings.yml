help_message_TIP: "/tip <b>username</b> <b>amount</b> <i>message</i>


Amount takes no trailing XMR symbol! Tip a user with a certain amount. All users who started the bot will be notified upon a tip.

Optionally you can specify a message to be sent along with the tip. This message will be forwarded to the user if that user has started the bot.

<b>Notice:</b>
Make sure the telegram user you want to tip actually exists, otherwise the moneros will be gone!!!


Unknown users to the bot, will be tipped regardless whether or not they exist in Telegram.

You cannot tip users within the bot PM, who do not have an account in the bot. Those users can only be tipped within a group.

Optionally, you can use the @ sign when giving the username. Exception to this is when you tip on a reply message. Then you don't need a username and only the amount.
Amount has to be a number. Use decimals if you need fractional amounts (like 0.1)."

help_message_SEND: "/send <b>address</b> <b>amount</b>

Amount has to be a number. Use decimals if you need fractional amounts (like 0.1)."

help_message_GIVEAWAY: "/giveaway <b>amount</b>


Amount takes no trailing XMR symbol! Make a giveaway within a telegram group.


This is a group command. If this bot is in a group and you are a member of that group, you can make a giveaway with the amount you want to give away. The first user in that group who clicks on the 'Claim' button will receive that amount and a tip will happen between the giver (you) and the taker.
Amount has to be a number. Use decimals if you need fractional amounts (like 0.1)."

Make sure you double-check the recipient address to make sure you are sending to the right address."

help_message_BALANCE: "/balance


Show your current balance. Balance is the total balance.

Unlocked balance is what is free to spend and the number of spent outputs gives you a hint to how many times you can tip.

If balance is locked the output will show the estimated time until unlocked."

help_message_GENERATEQR: "/generateqr <i>amount</i> <i>description</i>


Generate a QR-Code image with the desired amount and optionally a description to share with others. The other person can then paste this image into the bot PM and can do a transaction.


Every QR-Code image generated will use a new subaccount address to avoid giving away your main wallet address.


If you don't specify any parameter, it will generate a QR-Code image with just your subaccount address.


Example:

/generateqr 10 thank you for the donation. much appreciated! :)"

<b>Highlight</b>:

Upload a BITCOIN QR-Code with a correct URI (that is, with an amount encoded) and tag (add a caption to) the image with 'xmr.to' (without the quotes) before uploading it to the bot PM."
